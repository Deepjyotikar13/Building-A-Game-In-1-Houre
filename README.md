This is a very simple fighter jet shooter game that I made using Pygame. Actually, I made a video about it. Can I make a game in one hour? I gave myself this challenge. So, the code that I have uploaded is the code that I wrote in one hour. After I completed the game, I added comments to the code so that anyone can understand it because my code is a little messy. The comments that I have written, I hope I haven't done any spelling mistakes. And yeah, that's it. It's a very simple game. You can also make it or modify my code because it's not the best.
